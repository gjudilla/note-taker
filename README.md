## Usage

Click the link on the application's landing page to access the application. To add a note, click "New Note" on the upper right hand corner and type in your desired text and title. To clear the entry, click "Clear Form" on the upper right hand corner. Alternatively, to save the note, click the "Save Note" button. The entry will then appear on the left hand side, accompanying any existing notes. Clicking any previously entered notes will transfer the note to the right column and the user can choose to create a new note in its place.
